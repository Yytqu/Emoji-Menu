emoji-chrome-extension

Based on the https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/tut-focus-mode/ tutorial.

## To do: 

- Consume the emoji API, it needs to solve the CORS issue by having a server or something to work around it. 
- add the search functionality, it's related to the API
- Improve the UI  to have something nice, we are kind of fine. 
- check the CTR+B option, it's working
- integrate the extension with the textarea and have an event listener for the two dots and enable the search for that
- add the support for input fields
- the input event listener is working in the page but not in the content scripts.
